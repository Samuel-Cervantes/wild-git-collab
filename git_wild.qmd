## STEP 5: No merge conflicts!

```{r partner 1}
### In this code chunk, start with the diamonds dataset (built in to
### ggplot2 package) and create a plot of price vs. carat (or some other
### variables of your choice)


```

```{r partner 2}


library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
summary(diamonds)



```

## STEP 7: Uh oh, merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-1}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset.


```

## STEP 11: And even more merge conflicts!

```{r break-it-2}
### Both partners - delete this comment, then write some code here
### to plot, summarize, calculate something simple using the diamonds
### dataset.


```
